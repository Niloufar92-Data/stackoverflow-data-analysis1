# Data Science Blog Project: Analysis of the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey

## Overview

This project analyzes the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to explore trends in programming languages used by developers, languages they aspire to work with, and the relationship between language choice and job satisfaction.

## Motivation

Understanding the preferences and satisfaction levels of developers can help stakeholders (e.g., hiring managers, tech companies, and educators) make informed decisions about programming languages, frameworks, and other technologies.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **data/**: Directory containing the 2017 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset.
- **images/**: Directory containing any visualizations exported from the analysis.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, libraries used, analysis methodology, and summary of findings.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization

## Analysis Methodology

This project follows the **CRISP-DM** process:

1. **Business Understanding**: Identify key questions about developer trends.
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure.
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
4. **Modeling**: Analyze the data to answer the identified questions.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the findings and visualize the results.
6. **Deployment**: Share the findings in a blog post and GitHub repository.

## Questions Addressed

1. **What are the most commonly used programming languages among developers?**
   - Findings: [Describe the findings briefly]
2. **Which programming languages do developers most want to work with?**
   - Findings: [Describe the findings briefly]
3. **Is there a correlation between the languages developers use and their job satisfaction?**
   - Findings: [Describe the findings briefly]

## Summary of Findings

- The most commonly used programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
- Developers in the USA or Switzerland earn significantly more than those in some other countries.
Senior developers typically earn much more than junior developers, but the exact increase can vary by country.
- There is a positive correlation between using certain languages (like Python and Rust) and higher job satisfaction.
